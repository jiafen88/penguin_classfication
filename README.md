A dataset about Arctic penguins that comes from work of Dr. Kristen Gorman ((https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER (https://pal.lternet.edu/). This data is a common alternative to the famous Iris datasets and includes data on 344 individual penguins with 3 species represented.

One-hot-encoding was used to turn the non-numeric features into numbers. Since the dataset is fairly clean, a random forest model was used to predict the penguin types with very high accuracy (96%). You can predict penguin type either by using the pretrained model or uploading data to re-train the model.
